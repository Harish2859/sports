# Debug Flutter App Errors - TODO

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Added mounted checks before setState in async operations to prevent "Trying to render a disposed EngineFlutterView" error
- [x] Replaced recursive Future.delayed with Timer for OTP countdown and added cancellation in dispose
- [x] Added mounted check in _generateSportsId delayed callback

## Changes Made
- lib/verification.dart:
  - Imported dart:async
  - Added Timer? _otpTimer variable
  - Cancelled timer in dispose()
  - Updated _startOtpCountdown() to use Timer.periodic with mounted check
  - Added mounted check in _generateSportsId() Future.delayed callback

## Testing
- [x] Run the app and navigate through verification flow
- [x] Test OTP countdown timer
- [x] Test navigation away during async operations
- [x] Verify no disposed widget errors occur
