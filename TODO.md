# TODO: Update Message Page Content for Sports App

## Information Gathered
- The message page in `lib/message_page.dart` currently has LinkedIn-style content with professional networking users, titles, and messages.
- Sample data includes names like "Sarah Chen - Product Manager at Google", messages about job roles and connections.
- UI elements like app bar title "Messaging" and chat content need to be adapted to sports context.

## Plan
- [x] Update app bar title from "Messaging" to "Sports Chat".
- [x] Replace sample user data with sports-related names and titles (e.g., athletes, coaches, team members).
- [x] Change chat messages to sports-related conversations (training, matches, performance tips).
- [x] Update any LinkedIn-specific references to sports app context.

## Dependent Files
- `lib/message_page.dart`: Main file to edit with new sports-related content.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test the message page to ensure content displays correctly.
- [x] Verify no LinkedIn references remain.
